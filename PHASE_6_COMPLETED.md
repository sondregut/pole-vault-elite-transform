## What Was Implemented

### 1. Video Management Service (`src/services/videoManagementService.ts`)

Created a comprehensive video storage management service with:

#### Video Tracking
- **Get All Videos** - Fetch videos from all user sessions
- **Get Videos by User** - Filter videos for specific user
- **Get Largest Videos** - Find top 20 videos by file size
- **Video Metadata Extraction** - Pull from sessions and jumps

#### Storage Analytics
- **Calculate Storage Stats** - Total videos, size, costs
- **User Storage Usage** - Breakdown by user
- **Cost Estimation** - Monthly Firebase Storage cost
- **Average Video Size** - Mean size across all videos
- **Largest Video Tracking** - Identify space hogs

#### Storage Cost Calculation
- Firebase Storage pricing ($0.026/GB after 5GB free)
- Automatic billable storage calculation
- Monthly cost projection

#### Dashboard Aggregation
- `getDashboardData()` - Fetch all video data in parallel
- Recent videos, largest videos, user usage, stats

---

- Uses Video icon from Lucide React
- Route: `/vault/admin/videos`

#### App.tsx Routing
- Imported `VaultAdminVideoManagement` component
- Added nested route under `/vault/admin`
- Route path: `videos`

---

## Data Structure Requirements

### Session Documents

For video tracking to work, sessions should store:

```typescript
{
  videoUrl?: string,      // Firebase Storage URL
  videoSize?: number,     // File size in bytes
  createdAt: string | Timestamp,

  jumps?: Array<{
    videoUrl?: string,
    videoSize?: number,
    // ...other jump fields
  }>
}
```

### Required Fields
- `videoUrl` - URL to video in Firebase Storage
- `videoSize` - File size in bytes (for cost calculation)
- `createdAt` or `timestamp` - Upload date

---

## How to Access

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the admin panel:**
   - Go to `/vault/admin` (requires admin authentication)
   - Click on the "Videos" tab

3. **Manage videos:**
   - View storage statistics
   - Check cost estimates
   - Identify largest videos
   - See user storage breakdown

---

## Storage Cost Calculation

### Firebase Storage Pricing (2025)
- **Free Tier:** First 5 GB free
- **Paid Tier:** $0.026 per GB/month
- **Download:** $0.12 per GB (not calculated)

### Example Costs
| Storage Used | Free | Billable | Monthly Cost |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|
| 3 GB | 3 GB | 0 GB | $0.00 |
| 5 GB | 5 GB | 0 GB | $0.00 |
| 10 GB | 5 GB | 5 GB | $0.13 |
| 50 GB | 5 GB | 45 GB | $1.17 |
| 100 GB | 5 GB | 95 GB | $2.47 |
| 500 GB | 5 GB | 495 GB | $12.87 |

**Dashboard shows real-time cost estimates based on actual usage!**

## Mobile App Requirements

For accurate video tracking, the iOS app should:

### When Uploading Videos

**Save video metadata to session document:**
```typescript
{
  videoUrl: storageURL,
  videoSize: fileSizeInBytes,  // IMPORTANT for cost tracking
  uploadedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
}
```

**Or for jump videos:**
```typescript
jumps: [{
  videoUrl: storageURL,
  videoSize: fileSizeInBytes,
  // ...other jump fields
}]
```

### Get File Size

Before uploading to Firebase Storage:
```typescript
const fileSize = videoFile.size; // File size in bytes
```

### Why Video Size Matters
- Enables accurate storage cost calculation
- Helps identify optimization opportunities
- Allows setting upload limits
- Tracks storage growth over time
