## Data Structure

### Scheduled Notifications Collection

Documents in `scheduledNotifications` collection:

```typescript
{
  title: string,
  body: string,
  deepLink?: string,
  target: {
    type: 'all' | 'segment' | 'user',
    tiers?: string[],      // For segment targeting
    userId?: string,       // For user targeting
  },
  scheduledFor: string,    // ISO date string
  status: 'pending' | 'sent' | 'failed',
  createdAt: string,
  createdBy: string,       // Admin user ID
  sentAt?: string,
}
```

### Notification Logs Collection

Documents in `notificationLogs` collection (written by Cloud Function):

```typescript
{
  title: string,
  body: string,
  target: NotificationTarget,
  sentAt: Timestamp,
  deliveredCount: number,
  failedCount: number,
  openedCount?: number,
  createdBy: string,
}
```

## How Notifications Work

### Current Implementation (Web Admin Only)

1. **Admin composes notification** in the web dashboard
2. **Notification saved** to `scheduledNotifications` collection
3. **Status:** "pending"
4. **Waiting for:** Cloud Function to process and send

### Full Implementation (Requires Backend)

To actually send notifications, you need:

**Firebase Cloud Function:**
```
functions/sendNotification.ts
- Monitors scheduledNotifications collection
- Gets user FCM tokens from user documents
- Sends via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Logs results to notificationLogs
- Updates status to "sent"
```

**Mobile App:**
```
- Request notification permissions
- Get FCM/APNs token on app launch
- Save token to user document: fcmToken field
- Handle deep links when notification tapped
- Track opens (optional)
```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 4 for backend setup instructions.

---

## Mobile App Integration Required

For notifications to actually send and be received, the iOS app needs:

### TASK 1: FCM/APNs Token Management

**What to implement:**
- Request notification permissions on app launch
- Get FCM token (or APNs token)
- Save token to user document in Firestore

**What to write:**
```typescript
{
  fcmToken: string  // Token for push notifications
}
```

### TASK 2: Handle Notifications

**What to implement:**
- Background handler for incoming notifications
- Parse deep links (e.g., "vault://sessions/123")
- Navigate to correct screen when notification tapped
- Optional: Track notification opens

### TASK 3: Notification Preferences

**What to implement:**
- Settings screen for notification types
- Let users opt-out of marketing notifications
- Save preferences to user document

**What to write:**
```typescript
{
  notificationPreferences: {
    marketing: boolean,
    social: boolean,
    training: boolean,
  }
}
```

---

## Backend Required (Firebase Cloud Functions)

To actually send notifications, create:

### Function 1: Send Notification Handler

```typescript
functions/sendNotification.ts

Features:
- Monitor scheduledNotifications collection
- Trigger when new notification added
- Get user FCM tokens based on target
- Batch send (500 users at a time)
- Log to notificationLogs
- Update status to "sent"
```

### Function 2: Scheduled Notification Processor

```typescript
functions/processScheduledNotifications.ts

Features:
- Runs every minute (Cloud Scheduler)
- Check scheduledNotifications where scheduledFor <= now
- Process and send notifications
- Mark as sent
```

### Function 3: Auto-Notifications (Optional)

```typescript
functions/autoNotifications.ts

Triggers:
- Trial ending in 3 days
- Subscription renewal reminder
- Personal record achieved (on session create)
```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 4 Backend section for complete code.

---

## Important Notes

### Current Limitations

**Notifications are queued but not sent yet** because:
- No Firebase Cloud Function to process the queue
- No FCM tokens in user documents (mobile app not updated)

**To enable actual sending:**
1. Set up Firebase Cloud Functions (backend)
2. Update mobile app to store FCM tokens
3. Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging

### What Works Now

Even without backend:
- ✅ Full UI is functional
- ✅ Notifications save to Firestore
- ✅ Scheduling works
- ✅ History tracking ready
- ✅ Template system complete

The infrastructure is ready - just needs backend integration to actually deliver notifications.

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test the Notification UI
- Navigate to `/vault/admin/notifications`
- Test composing notifications
- Browse templates
- Verify audience targeting works

### Option 2: Set Up Backend
- Initialize Firebase Functions
- Create notification sender function
- Set up Cloud Messaging
- Configure scheduled processor

### Option 3: Continue to Phase 5
Move on to System Health & Monitoring:
- Error logs viewer
- API health checks
- Performance metrics
- Storage usage tracking
