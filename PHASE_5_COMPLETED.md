# Phase 5: System Health & Monitoring - COMPLETED ✅

**Completed:** January 28, 2025

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. System Health Service (`src/services/systemHealthService.ts`)

Created a comprehensive system monitoring service with:

#### Error Tracking
- **Get Error Logs** - Fetch errors from last 24 hours or custom time range
- **Calculate Error Rate** - Errors per hour over 24-hour period
- **Error Breakdown** - Group errors by screen/location
- **Recent Errors** - Get last 10 critical errors

#### API Health Monitoring
- **Check Firebase Connectivity** - Verify Firestore is accessible
- **Get Cached Health Status** - Read from apiHealth collection (set by Cloud Functions)
- **Service Status Tracking** - Monitor Firebase, RevenueCat, and other APIs

#### Performance Metrics
- **App Load Time** - Average time to launch
- **API Response Time** - Average response latency
- **Video Upload Time** - Average upload duration
- **Sample Count** - Number of performance measurements

#### Storage Monitoring
- **Storage Usage** - Total bytes/GB used
- **Cost Estimation** - Monthly Firebase Storage cost
- **Video Count** - Total videos stored

#### Dashboard Aggregation
- `getSystemHealthDashboard()` - Fetch all health data in parallel
- Error counts for 24h and 7d periods
- Real-time status updates

---

### 2. System Health Page (`src/pages/VaultAdminSystemHealth.tsx`)

Comprehensive system monitoring dashboard featuring:

#### Stats Cards (Top Row)
- **Errors (24h)** - Orange alert icon, error count
- **Errors (7d)** - Red alert icon, weekly error count
- **API Services** - Green server icon, healthy services ratio (e.g., "3/3")

#### Error Rate Chart
- Line chart showing errors per hour (last 24 hours)
- Continuous timeline (all hours shown, even with 0 errors)
- Orange line for visibility
- Angled x-axis labels for readability

#### API Health Status Panel
- List of monitored services:
  - Firebase Firestore
  - RevenueCat (placeholder)
  - Other APIs (from apiHealth collection)
- For each service:
  - Status icon (green checkmark, yellow warning, or red X)
  - Service name
  - Status message
  - Response time (if available)
  - Colored status badge

#### Error Breakdown by Screen
- Horizontal bar chart
- Shows which app screens generate most errors
- Top 10 screens from last 7 days
- Helps identify problematic areas

#### Recent Errors Table
- Last 10 errors in detail
- Red highlighted cards
- Shows for each error:
  - Error message
  - Screen where it occurred
  - Timestamp
  - User ID (if available)
  - App version
  - Platform
  - Expandable stack trace (click to view)

#### Empty States
- **No errors:** Green checkmark with "System is running smoothly!"
- **No API data:** Placeholder statuses shown
- **No error breakdown:** "No error data available"

#### Setup Instructions
- Blue info card (shown when no errors logged)
- Explains how to enable error tracking
- Lists required mobile app implementation
- Links to implementation guide

#### System Information Panel
- Error tracking status
- API monitoring count
- Firebase connection status
- Monitoring period (real-time)

### 3. Navigation Updates

#### VaultAdmin.tsx
- Added "System Health" tab to admin navigation
- Positioned between "Notifications" and "Promo Codes"
- Uses Activity icon from Lucide React
- Route: `/vault/admin/system-health`

#### App.tsx Routing
- Imported `VaultAdminSystemHealth` component
- Added nested route under `/vault/admin`
- Route path: `system-health`

## Data Structure Requirements

### Error Logs Collection

Documents in `errorLogs` collection:

```typescript
{
  userId?: string,
  error: string,              // Error message
  stackTrace?: string,        // Full stack trace
  timestamp: Timestamp,       // When error occurred
  screen?: string,            // App screen where error happened
  appVersion?: string,        // App version
  platform?: string,          // "iOS"
}
```

### API Health Collection (Optional, set by Cloud Functions)

Documents in `apiHealth` collection:

```typescript
{
  service: string,            // e.g., "RevenueCat", "Weather API"
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'down',
  lastChecked: Timestamp,
  responseTime?: number,      // Milliseconds
  message?: string,           // Status description
}
```

### Performance Metrics Collection (Optional)

Documents in `performanceMetrics` collection:

```typescript
{
  appLoadTime?: number,       // Milliseconds
  apiResponseTime?: number,   // Milliseconds
  videoUploadTime?: number,   // Milliseconds
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  userId: string,
}
```

## How to Access

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the admin panel:**
   - Go to `/vault/admin` (requires admin authentication)
   - Click on the "System Health" tab

3. **Monitor system:**
   - View error logs and rates
   - Check API health status
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Identify problematic screens

---

## Mobile App Integration Required

For full system health monitoring, the iOS app needs to log errors:

### TASK 1: Error Logging

**What to implement:**
- Wrap critical code in try-catch blocks
- Log errors to Firestore errorLogs collection
- Include error context (screen, user, version)

**What to write to Firestore:**
```typescript
await firestore().collection('errorLogs').add({
  userId: currentUserId,
  error: error.message,
  stackTrace: error.stack,
  timestamp: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  screen: currentScreen, // e.g., "LoginScreen", "SessionDetailScreen"
  appVersion: getAppVersion(),
  platform: 'iOS',
});
```

**Where to add:**
- Global error handler
- Critical user flows (login, signup, session creation)
- API calls
- Video uploads
- Payment processing

### TASK 2: Performance Tracking (Optional)

**What to implement:**
- Track app launch time
- Track API response times
- Track video upload duration
- Log to performanceMetrics collection

**What to write to Firestore:**
```typescript
await firestore().collection('performanceMetrics').add({
  appLoadTime: loadTimeMs,
  timestamp: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  userId: currentUserId,
});
```

### TASK 3: Analytics Events (Optional)

**What to implement:**
- Track feature usage
- Track screen views
- Send to Firebase Analytics (already built-in)

---

## Backend Required (Firebase Cloud Functions)

For enhanced monitoring, create:

### Function 1: Error Aggregation

```typescript
functions/aggregateErrors.ts

Features:
- Runs hourly
- Aggregate errors from errorLogs
- Calculate error rates
- Store in metrics/errors/{hour}
- Faster dashboard queries
```

### Function 2: API Health Checker

```typescript
functions/apiHealthCheck.ts

Features:
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks Firebase, RevenueCat, Weather API, etc.
- Measures response times
- Stores status in apiHealth collection
- Sends alerts if service is down
```

### Function 3: Storage Calculator

```typescript
functions/calculateStorage.ts

Features:
- Runs daily
- Calculate total Firebase Storage usage
- Count video files
- Estimate monthly cost
- Store in metrics/storage/{date}
```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 5 Backend section for complete code.
