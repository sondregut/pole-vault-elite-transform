# Phase 3: Content Moderation - COMPLETED ✅

**Completed:** January 28, 2025

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Moderation Service (`src/services/moderationService.ts`)

Created a comprehensive content moderation service with the following capabilities:

#### Report Management
- **Get Reported Posts** - Fetch all pending reports with associated post data
- **Dismiss Report** - Mark report as not requiring action
- **Mark Report as Handled** - Mark report as action taken

#### Post Moderation
- **Get Recent Posts** - Fetch last 50 posts from feed for monitoring
- **Delete Post** - Permanently remove post from feed
- **Hide Post** - Soft delete (keeps post but marks as hidden)

#### User Management
- **Ban User** - Prevent user from posting to social feed
- **Unban User** - Restore user's posting privileges
- **Get Banned Users** - List all currently banned users

#### Performance Optimization
- `getModerationDashboard()` - Fetches all moderation data in parallel
- Automatic user info enrichment for posts and reports

## Data Structure Requirements

### Reports Collection

Documents in `reports` collection should have:

```typescript
{
  postId: string,
  reportedBy: string,        // User ID who reported
  reportedUserId: string,    // User ID who created the post
  reason: string,            // Report reason
  additionalInfo?: string,   // Optional details
  timestamp: Timestamp,      // When reported
  status: 'pending' | 'handled' | 'dismissed'
}
```

### Feed Collection

Posts in `feed` collection should have:

```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  caption?: string,
  postText?: string,
  videoUrl?: string,
  imageUrl?: string,
  sessionId?: string,
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  sharedAt?: Timestamp,
  likes?: string[],
  comments?: any[],
  isHidden?: boolean,        // Set by Hide action
  hiddenAt?: string,         // When hidden
}
```

### User Document

Ban-related fields in user documents:

```typescript
{
  isBanned?: boolean,
  bannedAt?: string,
  banReason?: string,
  unbannedAt?: string,       // If previously banned
}
```

## Moderation Workflow

### Handling a Reported Post

1. **Review**: Admin sees report in "Reported Posts" tab
2. **Investigate**: View full post content and context
3. **Take Action**:
   - **Dismiss Report**: If report is invalid/spam
   - **Hide Post**: If content violates guidelines but user isn't malicious
   - **Delete Post**: If content is severely inappropriate
   - **Ban User**: If user is repeat offender or posted extreme content
4. **Auto-Update**: Report marked as handled, removed from pending queue

### Proactive Monitoring

1. **Browse Recent Posts**: Check "Recent Posts" tab
2. **Review Content**: Watch for potential issues
3. **Take Action**: Delete, hide, or ban as needed
4. **No Report Required**: Can moderate any post

### Managing Banned Users

1. **View Banned Users**: Check "Banned Users" tab
2. **Review Ban Details**: See reason and date
3. **Unban if Appropriate**: Restore posting privileges
4. **Track History**: All ban/unban actions logged

---

## How to Access

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the admin panel:**
   - Go to `/vault/admin` (requires admin authentication)
   - Click on the "Moderation" tab

3. **Moderate content:**
   - Review reported posts
   - Monitor recent posts
   - Manage banned users

---

## Security & Permissions

### Firestore Security Rules

Already configured in Phase 1:

```javascript
// Reports - users can create, admins can read/update
match /reports/{reportId} {
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() &&
    request.resource.data.reportedBy == request.auth.uid;
  allow read, update: if isAdmin();
  allow delete: if false; // Immutable
}

// Feed - admins can delete any post
match /feed/{postId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() &&
    (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
}

// Users - admins can update ban status
match /users/{userId} {
  allow write: if isOwner(userId) || isAdmin();
}
```

---

## Mobile App Integration Required

For full content moderation functionality, the mobile app needs:

### TASK 1: Add Report Post Feature

**Where:** Feed post menu (three dots icon)

**What to implement:**
- Add "Report" option to post action menu
- Show report reason selection dialog:
  - Inappropriate content
  - Spam or misleading
  - Harassment or bullying
  - Violence or dangerous behavior
  - Other (with text input)
- Create report document in Firestore

**What to write to Firestore:**
```typescript
await firestore().collection('reports').add({
  postId: post.id,
  reportedBy: currentUserId,
  reportedUserId: post.userId,
  reason: selectedReason,
  additionalInfo: optionalText, // if "Other" selected
  timestamp: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  status: 'pending',
});
```

### TASK 2: Check Ban Status

**Where:** Feed screen, create post functionality

**What to implement:**
- On feed screen load, check if current user is banned
- If banned, hide "Create Post" button
- Show message: "Your posting privileges have been restricted"

**How to check:**
```typescript
const userDoc = await firestore()
  .collection('users')
  .doc(currentUserId)
  .get();

const isBanned = userDoc.data()?.isBanned;

if (isBanned) {
  // Disable posting, show restricted message
}
```

### TASK 3: Handle Deleted Posts

**Where:** Feed display component

**What to implement:**
- Listen for post deletions in real-time
- Remove deleted posts from local state
- Optional: Show "Post removed" placeholder

**How to implement:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = firestore()
    .collection('feed')
    .onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
      snapshot.docChanges().forEach((change) => {
        if (change.type === 'removed') {
          // Remove from local state
          setPosts(prev => prev.filter(p => p.id !== change.doc.id));
        }
      });
    });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```
