# Phase 8: GDPR & Data Compliance - COMPLETED ✅

**Completed:** January 28, 2025

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GDPR Service (`src/services/gdprService.ts`)

Created a comprehensive GDPR compliance service with:

#### Request Management
- **Get Export Requests** - Fetch all data export requests
- **Get Deletion Requests** - Fetch all account deletion requests
- **Filter by Status** - View pending, processing, completed, or failed requests
- **Create Manual Export** - Admin-initiated data export for specific user

#### Compliance Tracking
- **Calculate Deadline** - Track 30-day GDPR compliance deadline
- **Urgency Levels** - Critical (≤3 days), Warning (≤7 days), Normal (>7 days)
- **Overdue Detection** - Identify requests past the 30-day deadline
- **Days Remaining** - Real-time countdown to deadline

#### Request Processing (Admin Actions)
- **Mark Export Completed** - Update status and add download URL
- **Mark Deletion Completed** - Update status and log deleted data counts
- **GDPR Statistics** - Total requests, pending, completed counts

#### Compliance Metrics
- Total export requests
- Total deletion requests
- Pending counts for each type
- Completion rate
- Overdue request identification

---

### 2. Data Management Page (`src/pages/VaultAdminDataManagement.tsx`)

Comprehensive GDPR compliance dashboard featuring:

#### Stats Dashboard (Top Row)
- **Export Requests** - Total count with pending badge
- **Deletion Requests** - Total count with pending badge
- **Compliance Rate** - Percentage of completed requests

#### GDPR Info Banner

#### Two-Tab Interface

**Tab 1: Export Requests**

For each export request:
- **User Information** - Name, email, user ID

---

### 3. Navigation Updates

#### VaultAdmin.tsx
- Added "Data Management" tab to admin navigation
- Positioned between "Feature Flags" and "Promo Codes"
- Uses Shield icon from Lucide React

## GDPR Compliance Requirements

### Legal Obligations (GDPR Article 15 & 17)

**Data Export (Right to Access):**
- Users can request all their personal data
- Must be provided within **30 days**
- Must be in a commonly used, machine-readable format
- Should include all data: sessions, videos, posts, preferences, etc.

**Data Deletion (Right to Erasure):**
- Users can request account deletion
- Must be completed within **30 days**
- Must delete all personal data
- Exception: Data required for legal/compliance purposes

---

## Data Structure

### Export Requests Collection: `dataExportRequests`

```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  userEmail: string,
  userName?: string,
  requestedAt: Timestamp,
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  completedAt?: string,
  downloadUrl?: string,           // Link to download ZIP file
  error?: string,
}
```

### Deletion Requests Collection: `dataDeletionRequests`

```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  userEmail: string,
  userName?: string,
  requestedAt: Timestamp,
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  completedAt?: string,
  error?: string,
  deletedData?: {
    sessions: number,
    poles: number,
    posts: number,
    videos: number,
  }
}
```

---

## How It Works

### User Flow (Mobile App - To Be Implemented)

**Data Export Request:**
1. User goes to Settings → Privacy → Request My Data
2. Taps "Request My Data" button
3. App creates document in `dataExportRequests` collection
4. Shows status: "Request submitted"
5. Cloud Function processes request
6. Generates JSON/CSV export
7. Uploads ZIP to temporary storage
8. Emails download link
9. Auto-deletes after 7 days

**Account Deletion Request:**
1. User goes to Settings → Privacy → Delete Account
2. Shows warning dialog with consequences
3. User confirms (enters password)
4. App creates document in `dataDeletionRequests`
5. Logs user out immediately
6. Cloud Function processes deletion
7. Deletes all user data permanently
8. Anonymizes references in feed/comments

### Admin Flow (Web Dashboard)

**Monitor Requests:**
1. Admin views Data Management tab
2. Sees all pending requests with deadlines
3. Urgent requests highlighted in red/orange
4. Can manually trigger exports if needed

**Track Compliance:**
1. Dashboard shows days remaining for each request
2. Overdue requests flagged prominently
3. Completion rate tracked
4. All actions logged for audit

---

## How to Access

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the admin panel:**
   - Go to `/vault/admin` (requires admin authentication)
   - Click on the "Data Management" tab

3. **Monitor compliance:**
   - View export requests
   - View deletion requests
   - Create manual exports
   - Track deadlines

---

## Backend Required (Firebase Cloud Functions)

For full GDPR compliance, create these Cloud Functions:

### Function 1: Data Export Processor

```typescript
functions/processDataExport.ts

Features:
- Triggered when new export request created
- Collect all user data:
  - User profile
  - All sessions with jumps
  - All poles and equipment
  - All social posts
  - Video URLs (not files, just references)
  - Preferences and settings
- Generate JSON and/or CSV files
- Create ZIP archive
- Upload to temporary Cloud Storage bucket
- Generate temporary download URL (7-day expiration)
- Email link to user
- Mark request as completed
- Auto-delete ZIP after 7 days
```

### Function 2: Data Deletion Processor

```typescript
functions/processDataDeletion.ts

Features:
- Triggered when new deletion request created
- Delete user document
- Recursively delete all subcollections:
  - sessions (including jumps)
  - poles
  - preferences
  - friends
  - notifications
- Delete videos from Firebase Storage
- Remove from social feed posts
- Remove from friend lists
- Anonymize comments/reports (replace userId with "deleted_user")
- Log what was deleted
- Mark request as completed
```

### Function 3: Scheduled Cleanup

```typescript
functions/gdprComplianceMonitor.ts

Features:
- Runs daily
- Check for requests nearing 30-day deadline
- Send alerts to admins if requests are overdue
- Auto-process if possible
- Generate compliance report
```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Phase 8 Backend section for complete code.

## Mobile App Integration Required

### TASK 1: Request My Data Button

**Where:** Settings → Privacy screen

**What to implement:**
- Add "Request My Data" button
- Show request status if pending
- Create export request in Firestore

**What to write:**
```typescript
await firestore().collection('dataExportRequests').add({
  userId: currentUserId,
  userEmail: currentUserEmail,
  userName: currentUserName,
  requestedAt: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  status: 'pending',
});
```

**Status Display:**
- "Request submitted" → "Processing" → "Ready to download"
- Show download button when status is "completed"

### TASK 2: Delete My Account Flow

**Where:** Settings → Privacy → Delete Account

**What to implement:**
- Warning dialog explaining consequences:
  - All data will be permanently deleted
  - Training sessions and videos will be lost
  - Action cannot be undone
- Password confirmation
- Create deletion request
- Log user out immediately

**What to write:**
```typescript
await firestore().collection('dataDeletionRequests').add({
  userId: currentUserId,
  userEmail: currentUserEmail,
  userName: currentUserName,
  requestedAt: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  status: 'pending',
});

// Log out user
await auth().signOut();
```

## Security & Privacy

### Firestore Security Rules

Already configured in Phase 1:

```javascript
// Data export requests
match /dataExportRequests/{requestId} {
  // Users can create for themselves
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() &&
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  // Users can read their own
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  // Admins can read all
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  // Only Cloud Functions can update
  allow update: if false;
}

// Data deletion requests
match /dataDeletionRequests/{requestId} {
  // Same as export requests
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() &&
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  allow update: if false;
}
```

## Current Status: UI Ready, Backend Needed

**What works now:**
