# ✅ UPDATED: Firebase-Based Invite System (No Supabase Needed!)

## What Changed

**Before**: The invite system was set up to use Supabase
**Now**: Everything uses **Firebase** (same database as your mobile app!)

## Why This Is Better

✅ **One Database**: Both website and mobile app use Firebase
✅ **Already Connected**: Your website already has Firebase configured
✅ **Simpler**: No need to manage two databases
✅ **Faster**: Direct connection, no extra API calls

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Add Firebase Security Rules (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select project: `pvt-app-440c9`
3. Click "Firestore Database" → "Rules"
4. **Copy the rules** from `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` file
5. **Paste** them into your existing rules (keep your existing rules!)
6. Click "Publish"

**✅ Done!** The `invite_links` collection will be created automatically when you create your first invite.

### Step 2: Install Mobile App Packages (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/simenguttormsen/Documents/Business/Vault

# Install required packages
npx expo install expo-clipboard @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy Website to stavhopp.no (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/simenguttormsen/Documents/Business/GForce/pole-vault-elite-transform

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**Make sure**: Your Vercel project is connected to `stavhopp.no` domain.

---

### Step 4: Verify AASA File (1 minute)

After deployment, check:

```bash
curl https://stavhopp.no/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

**Expected**: JSON with Team ID `4D4ADMM7XL` and Bundle ID `com.sondregut.pvtapp`

**If 404**: The file isn't being served. Check Vercel deployment.

---

### Step 5: Build Vault App (10 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/simenguttormsen/Documents/Business/Vault

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios
```

---

### Step 6: Test Everything! (5 minutes)

#### Test A: Create Invite Link

1. Visit: `https://stavhopp.no/vault`
2. Scroll to "Share Vault With Your Team" section
3. Click any share option
4. **Expected**: Invite code generated and shown

#### Test B: Open Invite Page

1. Visit: `https://stavhopp.no/vault/invite/TEST1234`
2. **Expected**: Landing page loads, code copied to clipboard

#### Test C: Universal Links (iOS Device)

1. Send yourself: `https://stavhopp.no/vault/invite/TEST1234`
2. Tap the link
3. **Expected**: Vault app opens (not Safari)
4. **Expected**: Alert shows invite code

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Data Flow

```
User Creates Invite
        ↓
Website (Firebase) → Creates document in invite_links collection
        ↓
Generates URL: stavhopp.no/vault/invite/ABC12345
        ↓
User Shares Link
        ↓
Recipient Opens Link
        ↓
Website (Firebase) → Reads invite from invite_links collection
        ↓
Shows Landing Page + Copies Code
        ↓
Redirects to App Store (if app not installed)
        ↓
Vault App Opens → Checks Clipboard → Finds Code!
        ↓
Mobile App (Firebase) → Validates invite + Creates friend connection
```

### Firebase Collections

**invite_links** (NEW):
- Stores invite codes
- Tracks usage
- 30-day expiration

**Your Existing Collections**:
- Users, sessions, jumps, etc. (unchanged)

## 🎯 Success Checklist

Before testing, verify:

- [ ] Firebase security rules added
- [ ] `expo-clipboard` installed in Vault app
- [ ] `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` installed
- [ ] Website deployed to `stavhopp.no`
- [ ] AASA file accessible
- [ ] Vault app rebuilt

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't create invite (Firebase error)

**Fix**: Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules are published

### Problem: Invite page shows "Invalid code"

**Causes**:
1. Invite doesn't exist in Firebase
2. Invite is expired
3. Invite already used

**Fix**: Create a new invite and try again

### Problem: Universal Links open Safari

**Fix**:
1. Uninstall app completely
2. Restart iOS device
3. Reinstall app
4. iOS will re-fetch AASA file

Just add the Firebase rules, deploy, and test!

## Questions?

If something doesn't work:
1. Check Firebase Console for errors
2. Check browser console on website
3. Check Xcode console for mobile app
4. Verify AASA file is accessible

The invite system will automatically create the `invite_links` collection in Firebase when you create your first invite - no manual database setup needed!
